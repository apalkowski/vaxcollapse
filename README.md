A framework for specific design of mRNA vaccine targets.

## Installation

VaxCollapse have been tested only on **Python 3.9**, however it may work on newer versions as well.

Please follow these steps to install:

Install dependencies. It is recommended to create a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) or use the [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html) manager to prevent conflicts with your system's Python environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running VaxCollapse

### Preparing sequence data

### Obtaining immunological features

VaxCollapse currently supports protein features inferred by the following software:

1. [BepiPred](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred-3.0)
1. [NetMHCpan](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan-4.1)
1. [NetMHCIIpan](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCIIpan-4.0)

#### NetMHCpan

Prediction of pan-specific binding of peptides to MHC class I alleles.

```bash
./netMHCpan -f <PROTEINS.FASTA> -l <PEPTIDE_LENGTH> -xls -xlsfile <OUTPUT_TABLE.TSV> -a <ALLELE_NAME>
```

The output file can be a part of NetMHCpan-included analysis as one of its inputs. The table within should have the following structure:

|         |             |        | HLA-A01:01 |           |              |             |         |        |
| ------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- | --------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------- | ------ |
| **Pos** | **Peptide** | **ID** | **core**   | **icore** | **EL-score** | **EL_Rank** | **Ave** | **NB** |
| 0       | MFVFLVLLP   | s_1    | MFVFLVLLP  | MFVFLVLLP | 0.0001       | 68.3333     | 0.0001  | 0      |
| 1       | FVFLVLLPL   | s_1    | FVFLVLLPL  | FVFLVLLPL | 0.0002       | 43.9091     | 0.0002  | 0      |
| 2       | VFLVLLPLV   | s_1    | VFLVLLPLV  | VFLVLLPLV | 0.0002       | 46.25       | 0.0002  | 0      |

#### NetMHCIIpan

Prediction of pan-specific binding of peptides to MHC class II alleles.

```bash
./netMHCIIpan -f <PROTEINS.FASTA> -length <PEPTIDE_LENGTH> -inptype 0 -xls -xlsfile <OUTPUT_TABLE.TSV> -a <ALLELE_NAME>
```

The output file can be a part of NetMHCIIpan-included analysis as one of its inputs. The table within should have the following structure:

|         |                 |        |            | DRB1_0301 |              |           |           |          |        |
| ------- | --------------- | ------ | ---------- | --------- | ------------ | --------- | --------- | -------- | ------ |
| **Pos** | **Peptide**     | **ID** | **Target** | **Core**  | **Inverted** | **Score** | **Rank**  | **Ave**  | **NB** |
| 1       | MFVFLVLLPLVSSQC | s_1    | NA         | LVLLPLVSS | 0            | 0.000041  | 90.740738 | 0.000041 | 0      |
| 2       | FVFLVLLPLVSSQCV | s_1    | NA         | LVLLPLVSS | 0            | 0.000059  | 88.25     | 0.000059 | 0      |
| 3       | VFLVLLPLVSSQCVN | s_1    | NA         | LLPLVSSQC | 0            | 0.00008   | 85.625    | 0.00008  | 0      |
| ...     | ...             | ...    | ...        | ...       | ...          | ...       | ...       | ...      | ...    |

#### BepiPred

Prediction of potential B-cell epitopes.

```bash
python bepipred3_CLI.py -i <PROTEINS.FASTA> -o <OUTPUT_DIR> -pred vt_pred -plot_linear_epitope_scores
```

The input file for BepiPred-included analysis should be `raw_output.csv` residing in the output directory given as an argument to the application. The table within should have the following structure:

| Accession | Residue | BepiPred-3.0 score | BepiPred-3.0 linear epitope score |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| s_1       | M       | 0.0239487458020449 | 0.0113448531677326                |
